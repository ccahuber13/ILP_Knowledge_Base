                <h1 id="1">Troubleshooting network latency</h1>
                <p>Latency is the time it takes for data to move from your local system to a ReadyTech datacenter. Latency can be
                    highly dependent on multiple factors such as internet service provider, weather, location, and network traffic.</p>
                <p>In general, the ILP works best with if your latency is 200ms or less. A lower latency number is better.</p>
                <p>Bandwidth is the overall amount of data that can be transferred over a connection. Bandwidth can be affected by the same network activities as latency. See <a href="ts_bandwidth_requirements.htm">bandwidth requirements</a> for more information.</p>
                <p>Multiple users on a single network must be taken into consideration as well. To learn how to calculate bandwidth for multiple students in a single location, see <a href="">calculating bandwidth for multiple students</a>.</p>
                <p>To troubleshoot high latency, try the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Switch from Wireless connection to hardwired, and vice versa.</li>
                    <li>Verify no large files or videos are being streamed on the network.</li>
                    <li>Verify your network supports at least <span class="bold">250 KBps</span> of download speed with our <a href="ts_bandwidth_calculator.htm">bandwidth calculator</a>.</li>
                    <li>If you are connected to a VPN, try disconnecting the VPN.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the above do not resolve your issue, continue to the next section changing the gateway settings.</p>
                <h3>Changing the gateway settings</h3>
                <p>In some instances of high network latency, changing the Gateway for the ILP can help. Note that the gateway can only be changed after you have logged in to the ILP.</p>
                <p>To change the gateway, follow the steps below:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Log in to the ILP.</li>
                    <li>Click your <span class="bold">name</span> from the user menu in the top right-hand corner, then click <span class="bold">Settings</span>.

                    <li>Select <span class="italic">DC2 Wiline HTTPS</span> from the <span class="bold">Gateway</span> drop-down list.
                        <img src="../../../../Resources/images/troubleshooting/01_ts.png" title="Troubleshooting" class="article__step-image" width="40%" /></li>
                    <li>Click <span class="bold">Save</span>.</li>
                    <li>Run the <a href="../ilp_getting_started/precheck_test.htm">pre-check connectivity test</a> to check if your latency has improved.</li>
                </ol>
